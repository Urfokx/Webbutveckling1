        <p>You take control of either P-body or Atlas who are robots built for testing by GLaDOS and together</p>
        <p>you and a friend solve tests with the help of eachother. You get your own portal device with different</p>
        <p>colors to seperate and know which portals are yours and which are your friends. There are six different</p>
        <p>courses to complete with your friend which are each about different elements but in some of the chambers</p>
        <p>previous elements are used together to solve the test. There is also a seventh course which unlocks after</p>
        <p>you complete the previous courses and has you completing chambers and eventually reach an old chassis with</p>
        <p>an old prototype of GLaDOS being controlled mindlessy by a crow, but Atlas scare it away and P-body locks it.</p>
